## 1. Problem Description
> Camping is one of the outdoor recreation. It can be done by individuals or groups of people. Camping includes lots of manual work, from building a tent to cooking. It’s about spending a night getting out of your comfort zone(your home) but staying in the woods. It’s a chance to get in touch with nature and get away from it.
>
> However, every campsite provides different facilities. It’s not an easy job to compare several candidates on sites. Finding campsites in certain areas and clicking websites for every site is difficult. Also, people's experience of the place can be completely different from what it’s described on its website.
>
> Another difficulty regarding camping is finding other campers who would camp together. For safety, knowing who will show up, how many people will go, and when they will get together for camping is essential.


## 2.Technical Solution
>Create an application for saving favorite campsites from a map and leave their own experience. Also, Make a forum where people can hold group camping.
>
> ### Scenario 1
> Lauren is considering taking a short camping trip for 3 days in California. She wants to reconnect with nature as much as possible. When deciding on the campsite, she wants one with good reviews and clean restrooms. She uses the campsite community application to read all the reviews from campers who have already visited there. She can get more trustworthy information about the campsite.
>
> ### Scenario 2
> Amanda wants to go camping. However, she has no one who would like to join her in her hobby. She doesn’t want to go by herself. She uses the campsite community application to find out if there’s some group camping coming up or if she should find people who would go with her. She decided to join a group camping around her place, and now she gets a chance to meet new people.
